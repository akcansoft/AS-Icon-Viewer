> A high-performance utility to browse, preview, and export icons from DLL, EXE, and ICO files, built with [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

**AS Icon Viewer** helps developers and power users browse, extract, and manage icons embedded in Windows executables (`.exe`), libraries (`.dll`), and icon files (`.ico`). Shortcuts (`.lnk`) are resolved to their targets, making it easy to build icon sets, find indices, copy to clipboard, and export high-quality assets.
